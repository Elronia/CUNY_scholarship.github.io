                <h3>New York City</h3>
                <p>New York City is made up of five boroughs which include Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. 
                    The city is the home of approximately 8 million people. In 1876, France gifted the City of New York what is known as the Statue of Liberty, which is currently located on Ellis Island commonly visited by tourists.
                    However, it took 10 years to assemble and therefore wasnâ€™t unveiled until 1886.
