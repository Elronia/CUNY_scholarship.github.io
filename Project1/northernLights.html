            <p><em>THE OTHERWORLDLY AURORA borealis,</em> or northern lights, begin high in the
            Earth's atmosphere-at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles—when charged
            particles from the sun become trapped in the Earth's magnetic field. The
            result is a colorful, dancing light show.</p>

            <p>The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica.
            Luckily, there are much more accessible places if you'd like to take in
            these light shows yourself. For the best seats to this celestial scene,
            consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55° and low light pollution.
            Find your magnetic latitude on NOAA and here.</p>

            <p>In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long
            winter nights are good but not necessarily the best time. Near equinoxes
            in March and September, the Earth's magnetic field lets more solar particles
            interact with the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal
            equinox in September, when there are pleasant temperatures in polar latitudes.
            Find the dark hours of your location here, or by using a sky guide app.</p>
