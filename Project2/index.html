            <p class="txt-right">The inspiration for the collection began with a series of archival sketches from the 1950s and 60s that featured brightly colored cocktail rings in unexpected shades. The jewelry aesthetic at that time was about magnificence and grandeur and for Harry Winston that meant creating the most extraordinary jewels, using signature techniques such as the pairing of fancy shaped stones with round brilliants and the use of intriguing color combinations. Realizing the potential of these incredible renderings, Winston Designers sought to create modern interpretations that recall the sophistication of a bygone era.</p>
