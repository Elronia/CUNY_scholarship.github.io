            <p>Sólheimajökull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Mýrdalsjökull and
            is surrounded by some of Iceland's most grand volcanoes and during
            summertime, a glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier only adding
            to the charm of the location. This popular day tour is the perfect way
            to get in real contact with the true reason behind the name Ice-land!</p>
