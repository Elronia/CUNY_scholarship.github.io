                    <b><i>Iceland</i></b>  is a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and ice co-exist. Where dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun. A country where insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.

                <p class="news-1">
                    nd of Sentence, by director Elfar Aðalsteins, receives very positive reviews in leading film industry magazines such as Hollywood Reporter. 
                The film’s two leading actors, John Hawkes and Logan Lerman, are also praised in both reviews. Hawkes has quite a few films under his belt and was nominated for an Oscar for Winter’s Bones and young Lerman is best known for his role in The Perks of Being a Wallflower.
                 Icelandic actor Ólafur Darri Ólafsson also has a small part in End of Sentence.
